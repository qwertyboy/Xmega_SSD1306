This is a modified version of Adafruit's SSD1306 library for OLED displays. This version WILL NOT work with
128x32 displays, and is SPECIFICALLY for 128x64. This version, however, uses hardware SPI for super-fast
update speeds, especially when used with the Akafuino X microcontroller board. I have no current plans to
re-implement I2C control or support for 128x32 displays with this port, but if you need it, drop me a line
and I can look into it.

Pinout for Arduino Uno:
	-Display Data to Arduino digital 11
	-Display CLK to Arduino digital 13
	-Display DC, Rst, and CS can be any pins





This is a library for our Monochrome OLEDs based on SSD1306 drivers

These displays use SPI to communicate, 4 or 5 pins are required to  
interface

To download. click the DOWNLOADS button in the top right corner, rename the uncompressed folder Xmega_SSD1306. Check that the Adafruit_SSD1306 folder contains Adafruit_SSD1306.cpp and Adafruit_SSD1306.h

Place the Xmega_SSD1306 library folder your <arduinosketchfolder>/libraries/ folder. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE.

You will also have to download the Adafruit GFX Graphics core which does all the circles, text, rectangles, etc. You can get it from
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
and download/install that library as well
